Dear Murad,

first of all, I would like to thank you for your willingness to work  on the
first task as part of your application process for my group. I do appreciate
this very much and would like to thank you for your time and effort in
advance. Attached you will find the task for today. As a hint, please focus
on the algorithm and data structures as well as the unit tests and read the
instructions very carefully.

We will evaluate your solution based on code quality, object oriented
modelling and design as well as how you approach unit testing. In case you
are used to test driven or test-first development, please apply it. If not,
don't try to use it in this task, it will not work out under the given time
pressure. Please use any programming language you feel comfortable with.

Please try to apply an incremental development style backed by unit tests.
This will allow you to submit a partial solution, which is quite acceptable!
The latest hand in time for your solution is 6.00 pm CEST.

*Please send me a short reply that you received this email*.

Good luck and best regards,

Alexander Stage
